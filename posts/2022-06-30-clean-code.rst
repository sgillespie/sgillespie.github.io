Functional Clean Code: Applying Clean Code to Functional Programming
====================================================================

Clean Code, by Robert C Martin, is known to be one of the best resources on principals,
patterns and practices of writing clean, maintainable code regardless of the language. 
The book primarily focuses on Object Oriented techniques. Unfortunately this was written
before functional programming features began to sneak into the most popular programming
languages.

Therefore, I want to go through the main topics of the book and explore how these can be
applied to modern programming languages.
