Becoming an Open Source Collaborator
======================================================================

  A Personal Experience Reflection

I have always wanted to be an open source contributor. It's important to me be involved 
in the ecosystem in meaningful ways. Recently, I finally gained write access to a large
open source repository. This post is a reflection on that experience, from submitting 
*good first issues*, to taking an active role in the project.

There are good resources on becoming a first-time contributor. However, what they do not 
include is becoming a *collaborator*. This requires overcoming challenges, such as finding 
impactful issues to work on, handling back-and-forth communication, and staying engaged. 

My aim is to acknowledge these challenges, describe how I overcame them, and give 
recommendations for aspiring open source developers.

Goal
====

The goal is to become a regular contributor of a large open source code base.

Challenges
==========

Finding Issues
--------------

After becoming a first-time contributor, you want to find more issues to work on,
especially non-trivial issues. However, combing through the issue backlog is time
consuming and requires a lot of effort. When you do finally find one, they may be
partially or poorly specified.

Many issues seem straightforward to implemenent. However, once you start to peel back
the layers, they may turn out to be more complex. It is not always possible to predict
how much work a task will be until actually starting it.

Finally, the issue list doesn't necessarily reflect the maintainers top priorities.
Just because an issue is open, doesn't mean it's important to the project right now.
Maintainers often have internal or implicit roadmaps.

Communication
-------------

The biggest challenge is learning how to deal with the back-and-forth communication. 
Feedback on PRs can feel circular with no real resolution. Sometimes you need to reach
out to maintainers of related projects--often without a response. The result, in some 
cases, can be stale PRs that never get merged.

Every project has its own review culture. This encompasses things like:

1. Do maintainers respond helpfully to questions?
2. Are people respectful in discussions?
3. Do PRs get reviewed?

Balancing Time
--------------

For me, another major challenge is finding the right balance of time to spend on the project.
The pace of open source development can sometimes feel slower, making it harder to work on
your own schedule. However, you don't want to neglect your other projects. Most
importantly, burnout is a serious problem, and must be avoided.

Resolutions
===========

This is a reflection of my unique experience, and may not apply to
everyone's situation. Nevertheless, in my case, I started out naively:

1. I read and took notes of the codebase from the top down.
2. I scoured issues until I found a handful that looked easy.
3. I whittled down the list until I found one or two I wanted to tackle.
4. Once I got my first issue merged, I tried to take on more advanced issues.
5. And then, I got stuck...

So how did it things finally turn around? Well, I got lucky! I went to a Hackathon, where
the project organizers set aside a few well specified issues, including instructions and 
examples. These issues were also split up into finer grained tasks that allowed many
people to work on them at the same time. Because of their hard work, I was able to attack
one of the fine grained tasks, get it merged, and then tackle another one. After a few of
these, along with some trivial CI fixes, I was granted write access.

This gave me the confidence to engage with the greater community. It led to joining a
standing dev call and participating in ongoing project discussions.

This experience was, in part, lucky, but it did give me some insights on how to
approach other open source communities.

Communication
-------------

The biggest challenge to becoming part of an open source community is communication. When
you're first starting out, begin by looking at the README, contributing guide, and code
of conduct. This will give you an idea of the communication conventions. Then read
through the issues and PRs, and observe how discussions take place. Finally, join the
communication channels, such as GitHub Discussions, Forums, Mailing Lists, Discord or
IRC, and observe.

Try to tackle a trivial change first, such as documentation, small CI fixes, or typos.
Going through this process will get you aquainted with the review culture.

If you do reach out for feedback, remember to be patient and respectful. Responses take
time, and they might not match your expectations.

Finding Issues
--------------

You're a skilled developer, and you want dive in and solve problems. So how do you find
issues to work on? Well, when you're first starting out, look for *easy* or
*good first issue* labels. These help you get your feet wet and start building
credibility.

When you're ready to try something more advanced, it's better to ask for guidance. For 
example:

  Hi, I have contributed to W and X on the project. I'm interested in areas Y and Z. Are
  there any particular issues or tasks that would be good for me to focus on next?

Getting Familiar with the Codebase
----------------------------------

You don't need to memorize the whole codebase from the beginning. You want to focus on the
parts that change the most, while building an understanding of how different modules interact. 
There's no way to know the most important pieces of code before you start, so build your
knowledge up gradually.

First, look for documents or commentary on the codebase. These can often be found
tucked in a contributing guide, project documentation or wiki. This can help you build
an intuition about the software architecture. Then, skim the project structure, noting 
the different subprojects or packages. Finally, as you take on more issues, dig deeper
into the relevant areas of the code.

Final Thoughts
==============

Becoming a collaborator is more than just being a contributor. It signals taking greater
responsibility in the success of a project. 

This has been a rewarding adventure, but it doesn't have to stop here. Open source
communities are interconnected, and there are more opportunities to be involved in
related communities. I'm excited to go through this journey again with other projects.

The key takeaways are to be patient, confident, and have a plan.
