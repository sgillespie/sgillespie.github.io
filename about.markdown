Howdy, my name is Sean Gillespie and I'm a functional programming enthusiast. I'm
currently interested in Programming Language Design, Continuous Integration, and Game
Development.

Here are some of my open source projects:

 * *[Lambda Calculus](https://github.com/sgillespie/lambda-calculus)*: An introduction to
   Lambda Calculus
 * *[Lambda Calculator](https://github.com/sgillespie/lambda-calculator)*: A Lambda
   Calculus interpreter
 * *[Elocrypt](https://github.com/sgillespie/elocrypt)*: A pronounceable password
   generator
 * *[NixOS Yubikey LUKS](https://github.com/sgillespie/nixos-yubikey-luks)*: Set up an
   encrypted filesystem with Yubikey pre-boot authentication on NixOS.
